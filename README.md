Usage:

- Example 1 t/m 4: Enter INPUT values as 0 or 1
- Example 5: Enter INPUT values as 00, 01, 10 or 01

Remarks:
- Terminate program simply by CTRL + C
- There's no error protection,
so after an erroneous input best restart the program.
- The programs have been compiled for Windows,
but due to their simplicity they should also compile on Linux and OsX.
- While simlogic.h and simlogic.cpp use C++ idiom,
the examples only use C'ish idiom.
