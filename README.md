Usage:

- Example 1 t/m 4: Enter INPUT values as 0 or 1
- Example 5: Enter INPUT values as 00, 01, 10 or 01

Remarks:

- The examples have been precompiled for Windows with g++ using compile_all.bat,
- As there is no Arduino board in this case, they will use console IO.
- Due to their simplicity the examples should also compile on Linux and OS X,
using appropriate C++ compilers and shell scripts or make files.
- When running in a console Window, terminate each program simply by CTRL + C.
- There's no error protection, so after an erroneous input best restart the program.
- While simlogic.h and simlogic.cpp use C++ idiom, the examples only use C'ish idiom.
